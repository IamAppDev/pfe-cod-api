Hello !
For my end of studies project, I created an app with ReactJs/NodeJs/ReactNative/Sequelize (video link for app demo = https://youtu.be/2r7JMIIGVbM ) during March, April, May, June.
It's my first experience with technologies listed above.
This is the API/Database part.
FrontEnd code: https://github.com/IamAppDev/pfe-cod-front
Mobile code: https://github.com/IamAppDev/pfe-cod-mobile

# pfe-cod-api
Database &amp; API

==> files named test*.js are for testing some code only, not for production.
==> I was working on the project alone, and no body supposed to review the code, that's why git commit messages are most of time meaningless for others, but there were clear for me.
